# Reactive Weather

## Story

People Always Talk About The Weather... They are always checking the weather in native and web applications.
Now you can go further and create your own web based Weather application!

## What are you going to learn?

- JS fetch API
- React UseState hook

## Tasks

1. Create a navbar with 4 links: `Bucharest`, `Budapest`, `Warsaw`, and a search bar
    - When the user clicks on the `Bucharest` link the browser url is changed to `localhost:3000/#/city/bucharest,ro` and the `City` page is displayed
    - When the user clicks on the `Budapest` link the browser url is changed to `localhost:3000/#/budapest,hu` and the `City` page is displayed
    - When the user clicks on the `Warsaw` link the browser url is changed to `localhost:3000/#/warsaw,pl` and the `City` page is displayed
    - The navbar is styled with `bootstrap` and looks similar to this image ![Nav Bar](media/frontend/reactive-weather-1.JPG)

2. When the user is on the `localhost:3000/#/[city,country]` route the weather for the city in that country is displayed by making a fetch call to `https://api.aerisapi.com/conditions/summary/${location}?format=json&client_id=${clientId}&client_secret=${clientSecret}` where `location` is taken from the [city,country] route, `clientId` & `clientSecret` the unique code generated by the account created at `https://www.aerisweather.com/`
    - When the user changes between the route `localhost:3000/#/city/budapest,hu` and `localhost:3000/#/city/budapest,hu` the minimum temperature, maximum temperature and feel like is displayed
    - The temperature is displayed in a `bootstrap` card which is centered vertically and horizontally in the page
    - The capitalized name of the city (without the country) also appears in the card (ex. `Stockholm` for `stockholm,se`)

3. The user can search for other countries in the search box from the nav bar and when a country is selected from the drop down menu the weather in that location is shown by reusing the `City` component
    - Typing `m` in the search bar displays a tooltip with the content `Stockholm`, `Milan`, `Madrid` and `Mykonos`
    - Selecting `Milan` from the dropdown menu changes the page url to `http://localhost:3000/#/city/Milan,it`
    - Selecting `Milan` the weather for `Milan` is shown
